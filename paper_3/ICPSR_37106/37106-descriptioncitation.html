								<p><span><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> TILDA Wave 3</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) is a major inter-institutional initiative led by Trinity College Dublin which aims to produce a massive improvement in the quantity and quality of data, research and information relating to older people and ageing in Ireland. Eligible respondents for this study include individuals aged 50 and over and their spouses or partners of any age. The study involves interviews on a two yearly basis with a sample cohort of 8,504 people aged 50 and over (or their spouses/partners) and resident in Ireland, collecting detailed information on all aspects of their lives, including the economic (pensions, employment, living standards), health (physical, mental, service needs and usage) and social aspects (contact with friends and kin, formal and informal care, social participation). Both survey interviews and physical and biological measurements are utilized. </p>
<p>The third wave of TILDA interviews were undertaken between March 2014 and October 2015. Of the 7,445 interviewed in Wave 2, a third interview was obtained for 6,874 respondents. These consisted of the self, proxy and end-of-life interviews types. In addition to the returning respondents, 28 interviews were obtained from eligible household members who had chosen not to take part in Wave 1 or the new spouses/partners of existing respondents.</p>
<p>Demographic and background variables include age, sex, marital status, household composition, education, and employment.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> These data were organized by Ipsos-MORI., ESRI - Economic and Social Research Institute, Dublin, Ireland were special collaborators., Additional information about The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing can be found at the <a href="http://tilda.tcd.ie/">TILDA</a> Web site.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> This research aims to produce a massive improvement in the quantity and quality of data, research and information relating to older people and ageing in Ireland.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> The sample design incorporates stratification, clustering, multi-stage selection, and representative probability sampling. The dataset contains the cluster variables CLUSTER and HOUSEHOLD. The selection of geographic clusters was stratified, so that equal numbers of clusters were selected from each of three socio-economic groups. The socio-economic status of a cluster was defined by the proportion of individuals in that cluster. Please refer to the Release Guide for additional information on sampling.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Individuals aged 50 years and older and their spouses or partners of any age, who are resident in Ireland.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Individual, Families/Households</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> clinical data, survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), face-to-face interview, mail questionnaire, self-enumerated questionnaire</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> <p>Self-Completion Questionnaire: 85%</p>
<p>Comprehensive Health Assessment:  82%</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Presence of Common Scales:</strong> Several commonly used scales have been constructed based on the CAPI and SCQ data and these are included along with other derived variables. Derived variables are prefixed with an uppercase code which indicates the research area to which they relate. Please see the Derived Variables codebook for more information on these variables.</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
